		<p> I loved this movie due to how suspenseful every scence was.
	It was so supsenseful because the group trying to catch them seemed 
	so close then they turned all aroud in a big magic reveal. </p>
	
	
	<p> Jesse Eisenberg was my favorite actor due to how well he portayed his character
	and how he brought the rest of the story to life.</p>
